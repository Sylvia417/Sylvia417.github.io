## February

- **2/2** Went to that woman's (From Xiao Hong Shu) house and got my satifying haircut, 10$

- **2/8** Made Shou Zhua Bing by myself, climbed the nearest mountain

- **2/9** Built my blog website

- **2/13** After some hesitation, I decided to go to the closest little mountain to see the sunset, saw a man taking photos of the moonrise, which led me to start a conversation with a local girl named Marie, exchanged contact information happily. Made me crazy for not working in a whole month.

- **2/15** In the Zumba class, the first song was September, at that moment, I felt like I was in a dream, I like this song very much bcos the anime movie Robot Dreams, and I lost in my mind and couldn't catch up teacher's steps in the whole song.

- **2/17** Really felt uncomfortable, I used to think I wasn't prone to catching colds, but I've come down with one, indicating a slight fever, 37.3Â°C. I'm experiencing body aches, fatigue, a heavy and foggy head, a sore and swollen throat, thick yellow phlegm in the mornings. And I still didn't figure out how to see a doctor here. 

- **2/19** Today when I was using the rack to loose the sand pit (the indian teacher Mihiri told me to do it), the chinese teacher Joy stood next to me and mentioned that Mihiri can't do this, because she has been diagnosed with breast cancer and had one breast removed, which limits her to do many physically demanding tasks. On one hand, I feel like it's no surprise she developed a gynecological illness given her bad temper, on the other hand, I now more understand why she is so bossy and often delegates tasks to others.

- **2/21** I went to the church for play group activity, but only several children showed up, while helping around the church, I replied to piano inquiry emails. It feel nice to be more accepted by the members of the church, and Janine was always so helpful and told me it's okay that I'm not a christian, everyone has their path in life. I wrote those emails to help Li to get a free new Yamaha piano and I did everything from head to foot. I reflected if I am a people-pleaser. If I don't do it, I feel guilty; if I do it, I don't really happy to prioritize others over myself. And finally, undoutedly, the free piano thing, it's a scam.

- **2/23** Went to the malaysian restaurant to take an interview. Enjoyed BBQ in the church, it was more of a social gathering, I sat next to Mary and Elizabeth. Mary is a typical England lady who's 81 yo. I forgot to tell her that her lipstick matched her top, both pink. Before that Elizabeth took me inside to fetch a book. After dinner, Mary told me about her love story, and she was curious about my hometown, I briefly introduced to her in my poor English, she even asked me to write down the city's name so she can look it up online later.

- **2/26** I wrote several resume to apply for different jobs in seek web, but there's a slim chance to even get one answer.
