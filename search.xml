Made me crazy for not working in a whole month.</p></li><li><p><strong>2&#x2F;15</strong> In the Zumba class, the first song was September, at that moment, I felt like I was in a dream, I like this song very much bcos the anime movie Robot Dreams, and I lost in my mind and couldn’t catch up teacher’s steps in the whole song.</p></li><li><p><strong>2&#x2F;17</strong> Really felt uncomfortable, I used to think I wasn’t prone to catching colds, but I’ve come down with one, indicating a slight fever, 37.3°C. I’m experiencing body aches, fatigue, a heavy and foggy head, a sore and swollen throat, thick yellow phlegm in the mornings. And I still didn’t figure out how to see a doctor here. </p></li><li><p><strong>2&#x2F;19</strong> Today when I was using the rack to loose the sand pit (the indian teacher Mihiri told me to do it), the chinese teacher Joy stood next to me and mentioned that Mihiri can’t do this, because she has been diagnosed with breast cancer and had one breast removed, which limits her to do many physically demanding tasks. On one hand, I feel like it’s no surprise she developed a gynecological illness given her bad temper, on the other hand, I now more understand why she is so bossy and often delegates tasks to others.</p></li><li><p><strong>2&#x2F;21</strong> I went to the church for play group activity, but only several children showed up, while helping around the church, I replied to piano inquiry emails. It feel nice to be more accepted by the members of the church, and Janine was always so helpful and told me it’s okay that I’m not a christian, everyone has their path in life. I wrote those emails to help Li to get a free new Yamaha piano and I did everything from head to foot. I reflected if I am a people-pleaser. If I don’t do it, I feel guilty; if I do it, I don’t really happy to prioritize others over myself. And finally, undoutedly, the free piano thing, it’s a scam.</p></li><li><p><strong>2&#x2F;23</strong> Went to the malaysian restaurant to take an interview. Enjoyed BBQ in the church, it was more of a social gathering, I sat next to Mary and Elizabeth. Mary is a typical England lady who’s 81 yo. I forgot to tell her that her lipstick matched her top, both pink. Before that Elizabeth took me inside to fetch a book. After dinner, Mary told me about her love story, and she was curious about my hometown, I briefly introduced to her in my poor English, she even asked me to write down the city’s name so she can look it up online later.</p></li><li><p><strong>2&#x2F;26</strong> I wrote several resume to apply for different jobs in seek web, but there’s a slim chance to even get one answer.</p><h2><span id="marth">Marth</span></h2></li><li><p><strong>3&#x2F;01</strong> I went to the Malaysian restaurant (Mama Kopitiam) for a trial shift, he, the boss Bret, is really a short-tempered person, always staring at everything with a frown. And he was really unsatisfied with my performance. I think I even can’t get paid for it. But their cusine looks really good and hygiene (much better than many chinese restaurants), I really want to try, but they’re really expensive for me.</p></li><li><p><strong>3&#x2F;02</strong> I asked that Chinese restaurant (Maya Hotpot) manager again to know if I was still considered an employee and whether there was any chance to work there, as I already gaped over one month and a half. She said she will ask the Boss Eric, but didn’t get back to me. In the midnight, Boss just removed me from the Wechat group (Later I knew he just dismissed the group). I prepared over 50 emails to send to different kindergartens that I can reach on my scooter (within 8km), and I found it (outlook) only allows about 10 emails to be sent per day.</p></li><li><p><strong>3&#x2F;03</strong> Not everything is bad, I got an opportunity to be a reliever in a kindergarten in Ellerslie. Amazing, I am so happy! I should have focused on this kind of job from the start instead of wasting time applying to restaurants and other unrelated jobs (And it’s so embarrassing that I only have restaurant work experience in Auckland! I’m an ECE teacher!). But better late than never. I still have a half year to gain more experience before looking for a formal job after graduation. And I found that, no matter those chinese who have obtained PR (Wang Family), those who have been working and studying here for several years (manager Merry), or those who left NZ and really want to come back (Vivi, an older girl I never met in person but sometimes chat with, who worked at the same restaurant as me before. Maybe it’s really tough for her to find a job in China, even if she does, it’s unlikely to pay well–Salaries in China are very low, all business owners will reduce costs by lowering wages), or those who have plenty of free time but never truly dedicate themselves to improve English (Li, Wang’s wife), they all feel limited by their English skills.</p></li><li><p><strong>3&#x2F;05</strong> Today the family I lived with had a big quarrel, finally they were fine. And I just thought that, what’s the big difference between animals and children, and adults. Animals and children don’t really reflect on everything. They have emotions and a sense of self, but they don’t fully understand what’s happening, and why, or what’ll come next. But does that mean they can’t learn? Ocs they can, like wolf Green in the documentary, he’s so smart. My English is really bad and I need to do more to improve. I need to read more books, and learn more songs and explore picture books. I need to be a good ECE teacher to support my life in NZ. So many things to do. Looking back, I realize I wasted many time in unrelated work (restaurant) and volunteering everywhere. I rushed into places saying I wanted to be a volunteer. But the truth is, I just wanted to meet people. I didn’t actually need to do it, now I see that. And in doing so, now I have to break some of my promisions I made about being a volunteer.</p></li></ul>]]></content>
